title: Failing Resolutions

So... maybe making a resolution to write 250 words a day wasn't the best project to start right before Christmas and New Years. I can see that now.  But, this slow start demonstrates a truth about almost any resolution.

*You will break it*

I'm not hating on your willpower or the quality of your resolutions, but lets be honest at some point in the future (which is a very long time) you'll most likely break your resolution. If you committed to better eating, you'll probably have a donut, not smoking - cigarette, exercise daily - you'll miss a day.  Whatever it is, it doesn't really matter.

The key is what you do afterwards.

I used to feel that if I'd failed once in my resolution then I might as well stop trying to keep it because I had already broken it. I don't know if I'm alone in this (I doubt it), but at some point I realized the flaw in what how I was holding myself accountable, and punishing (or rewarding) myself by dropping my resolutions. So then I figured something out.

*Forgive yourself and move on*

Once I stopped beating myself up about my failures, it became much easier to hold on to resolutions. Each one was no longer a rule that I was breaking, but was a guide to a better way of doing ________. So, even if I did miss a day or eat something I shouldn't my resolution still stands.
