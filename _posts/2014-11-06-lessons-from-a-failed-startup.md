title: Lessons I learned from failing my startup
---

Triage
------

I started a Bandpass with a co-founder in January.  By mid-October, we decided that it wasn’t right and decided to end it.  Looking back over my experience as a first time founder, these are some of the lessons that I’ve learned.
None of these topics are new.  I read or heard about every single one of these pitfalls before Bandpass. Despite “knowing” about these obstacles, I still stumbled over them.  Sometimes reading words doesn’t really translate to actionable behaviors until you experience it for yourself.  I reiterate these lessons with a little bit of coloring from my own experiences, both to solidify the lessons for myself, and to maybe help someone.

My real advice any readers of this is the same that I tell my students; be ok making mistakes; be ok sucking.  

You’ll learn more from cleaning up your mess than you ever would by following someone’s guide to perfection.  

Now without further ado:
* [Pick something you believe in (believe in your product)](#believe)
* Use data to drive decisions
* Find your audience
* Be fearless, let the world tell you no
* Set goals and meet them or figure out why you didn’t
* Accept your mistakes and move on
* Make decisions and execute

###Believe in your product
</div>
It was tempting to jump at the first great idea that we had.  I had just quit my job at Microsoft and I wanted to move, and move quickly.  As a result my co-founder and I started moving on Bandpass as an idea before I had really started to believe in it as a product that the world needed.  By not being fully confident about Bandpass I crippled my ability to sell it, and I spent time worrying about the idea that should have been spent working on the product.  
This might be the most important thing about starting a company.  There are going to be plenty of situations where the necessary action for your company is personally difficult or you’ll have to convince people that what you are working on is essential.  I found it difficult to do this for Bandpass, since I never really believed in the core elements of the project.  It just took me months to admit that to myself and even longer to admit it openly to my co-founder.

###Use data to drive decisions
I can’t stress enough how important it is to know how your company is doing.  For Bandpass we spent the first couple months working with google analytics looking at page views.  This is fine for a landing page, but we had a prototype out there and didn’t have any visibility about how people were using it.  Ultimately the opacity of our prototype was demoralizing and hampered our ability to know what to work on with confidence.  
Build analytics into your product from day one, and make actionable goals that you can strive for based on those analytics.

Another issue with Bandpass was a lack of actionable hypotheses with some kind of decision tree stemming from them.  We spent the first couple of months flying blind with vague indicators of success or a lack of it from google analytics.  Those are good for a broad picture of page views, but can only take you so far into understanding yhour customer base.  What we needed was a much more detailed view of who our customer was and how they were using our site.  What buttons were they pressing, what feature did we think was great that no one even saw?  Anything really.  And the effect of not tracking wasn’t just an opaque userbase, but it was also demoralizing for us.  We couldn’t move forward with confidence that our last release, or latest bug fix, was actually helping the users of our site.  

###Be Fearless, let the world tell you no
“You don’t ask… You don’t get”
These are some of my mother’s favorite words, and they apply perfectly to many situations I found myself in.  Starting a company requires you to put yourself out there in many significant ways.  You need to sell your idea (which starts to feel like yourself) to your customers, your investors, your peers, and everyone else along the way.  In the face of this constant scrutiny I found myself reasoning why this person wasn’t going to like it, or why that investor wouldn’t fund it, and instead of putting myself out there and letting the world tell me no, I didn’t ask.  

###Set goals
Another issue with our working style was a lack of clear goals during the development process.  Often it came from an inability to identify the singular most important next step, so we would have a bunch of things going on at once and make progress on a bunch of them simultaneously.  This way when I slipped one deadline we could point to some other element of the business and say we were working on that.  This didn’t work for us.  What we’ve started to do is have much more granular and limited weekly goals, that build up to a large monthly or quarterly goals.  By holding myself accountable to these goals, I’m able to get more discrete tasks done and I generally feel better having checked them off my list.  
There was definitely fear of picking thewrong task that held me backfrom committing to them while working on bandpass, when in reality I would at most lose 2 or 3 days of work and would definitely learn something from committing to completion of a task

###Accept mistakes
I could have saved myself 

###Decide and execute
This goes hand in hand with the goals that you need to set. Don’t overthink your problems.  Make decisions and execute based on them.  Don’t spend to much time going over the pro’s and con’s of a choice, whether it be what technology to work with or what to do next.  Pick one, make it work, and then reevaluate at some point in the future.  Once again, even if you make the wrong choice you’ll be much better informed for the next round of work.
