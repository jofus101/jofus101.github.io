Hey All,

Welcome to my blog! I've wanted a place to share bits and pieces about my life and the ideas that are keeping me awake. 

I also want a space to help me improve my writing. I'll be honest, I don't really like writing, but I value efficient communication, and want to work on that skill.

I imagine that this blog will help me stay accountable to certain goals I've set for myself. I also believe it’ll help me solidify and fully think through interesting ideas. It’s easy to come up with the bones of an idea and believe it’s good if you don’t have to elaborate. Attempting to communicate the ideas that I have will help me determine if it's worthwhile.

Looking forward to what's to come.  

-Joseph
