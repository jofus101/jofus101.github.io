What is your definition of success?

Money, children, professional recognition, the company of good people, a creative life?

For most of my life, success was defined for me. I was expected to do well in school and get a good job. It was well defined path that many of my peers would walk with me and it ends after college. I know I struggled (and still do to some extent) with how to define success for myself after completing the prescribed path set out by my family, community and peers.

Once I entered the "real" world I had to suddenly define success for myself. Did I want to really commit my time and energy to the corporate ladder? Would that extra money make me happier? When there are no due dates, how do I justify ditching my friends so I can sit alone in a room and draw? Who should I surround myself with? How much time should I devote to those relationships? How important is exercise and fitness? How do I want to balance work and life?

These questions and answers are unique to everyone, and I know it's a privilege to have the definition of success as something I grapple with. But it's something that everyone should examine. I know I don't have it figured out entirely, but I'm ok with that. I'm aware of the question, and I have been implementing systems that work for me, help me define my own success and keep me on track. I encourage you to do the same.
