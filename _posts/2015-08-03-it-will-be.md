It will be.

I tried tracing the decisions that led me to where I am right now.  It's a surreal experience. So many major components of my life are the result of almost haphazard circumstance. An absent friends ticket, a spur of the moment decision to volunteer, a party in December.  Looking backwards I can see how the butterfly flapped, but there is no way I could have foreseen this path as a result of my decisions, though in a way it feels inevitable.

It will be.

It's been comforting to see things roll along, and it's been helpful to maintain that perspective when things don't go the way I expected. I've been lucky enough to be able to sleep off most things, knowing that the situation won't be much different in the morning, but at least my perspective will improve. And that seems to help more often than not. A good nights sleep and faith that if I try to put good out there,

It will be.
