Hey folks,

It's been quite a while since my last post. Things have been pretty busy and changed drastically, but I'm settling into more of a routine and I'm looking forward to writing again. I've got a new job now as a Technical Product Manager for Mobile with Dow Jones. I'm about three months in at this point and it's been quite the ride.  I've been learning about all different facets of the business and really enjoying it as I get to work on nuts and bolts with my dev team as I run Scrum, participate in high level strategic meetings with executives, and do anything and everything in between.

It's an exciting time, and I'm looking forward to once again sharing some of what I have, and will, learn with all of you.

Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.
