title: Your left hand hates you - The case for sucking
---

One thing I always say to new students (and myself when learning something new) is, "be ok sucking". I've seen so many people get frustrated with learning something when it's hard, or they're clumsy, or their left hand hates them (which it does... my left hand tries to sabotage everything I do), and those people throw up their hands and say some crap like "*I'm not artistic,*" or musical, or good with my hands.... What I wish I could impress more easily is that everyone starts out at the beginning, and you can't compare your beginning to the experts around you (or even the people you started with, who knows what their history contains).
