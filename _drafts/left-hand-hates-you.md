title: Your left hand hates you
---

To my dismay I've noticed that my left hand hates me. It doesn't seem to be a personal vendetta, but my left hand is recalcitrant, clumsy, and generally uncooperative. I've tried finding the source of it's discontent and have come up with nothing. It could be the years that it has spent merely holding the paper while my right hand had the glorious task of writing, drawing, or doodling.  It could be that it always wanted to throw a baseball instead of merely catch one (I honestly gave it a chance... but it can't throw for the life of it). Or maybe my right hand has just been talking shit and my left hand is done.  

Whatever the case, I have to work doubly hard to convince it to do things. And maybe that's the point. Maybe it just needed a little extra love and a little more patience.

But, and I've seen it in my own renegade appendage, with practice, even a left hand can become useful.  It takes some [suckage]({% post_url 2015-01-05-ok-sucking %}), and sometime it helps to sleep on it to let skills filter through its obstinate nature, but it can become useful.  I mean... I'm using both hand to type right now, so here we are.

I'm sure there's a metaphor in here somewhere for something more substantial.  It could be about dealing with people, or learning something new, or being patient when learning, but I'm gonna leave those as an exercise for the user.

PS. If you're a lefty you know what hand I'm talking about.

PPS. If you're ambidextrous, I'm jealous.


I've seen so many people get frustrated with learning something when it's hard, or they're clumsy, or their left hand hates them (which it does... my left hand tries to sabotage everything I do), and those people throw up their hands and say some crap like "*I'm not artistic,*" or musical, or good with my hands.... 

You are in good company

What I wish I could impress more easily is that everyone starts out at the beginning, and you can't compare your beginning to the experts around you (or even the people you started with, who knows what their history contains).
