I remember what it was like to start work at Microsoft. I had this impression that at a company like Microsoft (they made windows for goodness' sake) everything ran smoothly. You weren't going to run into wireless issues at Microsoft, every process was streamlined, and the printers never jammed. I soon came to realize something that's true for probably every company ever. It's just a bunch of people getting things done! There really isn't any magic sauce. It takes planning, work, and improvisation to accomplish anything whether you're at Microsoft, a startup, or just trying to do your laundry.
