I want to commit to writing every day of the work week.  So, here I am, publicly committing to write around 250 words a day. I don't really know if that'll be enough but if feels like a good place to start.  

Today, I'll discuss this article about [deliberate practice](http://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice) that really struck a chord with me, and is partially the impetus for this dedication to a writing word count.
