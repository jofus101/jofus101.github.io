> Why are you applying to The Flatiron School Pre-College Summer Academy Teaching Fellowship? (<300 words recommended) *

My Coordinator at Scripted, Becca Novak, recommended the program to me and I'm interested for a number of reasons. I've been teaching with Scripted for most of this year and I really enjoy it. I've taught a number of different topics over the years from pottery and glassblowing, to dance, to computer science. There's something about the successful transmission of information that is exhilarating. 
Teaching is also really difficult. I've recently started reading more about the craft of teaching (TLC anyone?), and have been successfully applying those lessons to my teaching. I like crafts, I like learning more about a material (clay, movement, cs, information) and as such teaching is a wonderful combination of my passions. So, when Becca recommended the Flatiron program it seemed like a perfect way to professionally explore a field that I know I love.

I studied CS in college and worked for Microsoft for a couple of years after school. I ran and taught at a Ceramics studio for a number of summers where I taught kids aged ten to fifteen. I have TA'd glassblowing classes in Seattle. I currently am the primary developer for my own startup and did a lot of backend work on my previous two startups [bandpass.fm](http://bandpass.fm) and [Shuhari](http://shuhari.io). Shuhari was also an idea I had for a more structured way of learning that came from my own experience teaching myself multiple disciplines including Poi for which I subsequently created a [syllabus](http://poi.shuhari.io)



> The ability to think in a structured way, both creatively and quantitatively, to solve complex problems is an important element of being a successful developer. Can you tell us anything that demonstrates your abilities in that realm? (anything from standardized test scores to experience playing a musical instrument counts). (<250 words recommended)
