After being graduated with degrees in CS and Sculpture, Joseph went to work for Microsoft in Seattle for three years. While there, he discovered the "joys" of legacy code and how to get things done in a large company.  He has since moved to the brighter pastures of web technology and the NY startup scene. As a terrible writer committed to becoming better, he started regularly posting collections of words about things to a personal blog. An avid learner of everything, he can also be found doing a slightly ridiculous number of hobbies around NY.
