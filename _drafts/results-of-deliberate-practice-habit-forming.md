title: Results of deliberate practice and forming habits

I wrote about [deliberate practice]({% post_url 2014-12-19-deliberate-practice %}) about two months ago and I'd like to share how it's going and how it has evolved in my life.

My initial commitment was to write ~250 words a day. Clearly that didn't work.  I'm bumping around 250 words a week, and I'm feeling pretty good about that. My resolution to write consistently hasn't changed despite my initial [failure]({% post_url 2015-01-01-failing-resolutions %}), I've just made my resolution fit the reality of my life and goals. 

However, I have been forming daily habits by following the [Seinfeld method, Don't Break the Chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret), and it has been great! Decide upon a manageable task that relates to a skill you want to improve and *do it every day*. For example, I've chosen art, fitness, and poi (I should probably throw code on there, but I do that everyday anyhow). 

One of the reasons I think this has been successful is that I'm not killing myself over it or setting unreasonable goals. I'm not committing to finishing a painting a day. I can do some pottery, some woodworking, 10 minutes of sketching or anything else that I feel gets my creative juices flowing. I'm just focused on moving the chains forward. My fitness goal is covered by a 2hr climbing session, Capoiera, or 20 minutes of yoga. More than the actual activity or output it's the consistency of practice that I have found important.

It's only been about 2 months but I'm excited to add more goals, and see where they take me. I have already begun to see a change in my life as these habits become integrated into my daily routine.

Let's see where this goes.  

ps. I'm using [Routinely](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.braavos.apps.routinely&hl=en) to track my habits at the moment. But I'm not 100% sold on it. Anyone do something similar and have other preferred apps?
