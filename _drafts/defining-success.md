How do we as adults define success.  Everyone wants to be successful but what does that mean to me?  How can others interpret that

I've had a couple conversations recently with some of my peers about our definitions of success.  It's an odd thing to think about and it


What is your definition of success?

Money, children, professional recognition, the company of good people, a creative life?

For most of my life, success was defined for me. I was expected to do well in school and get a good job. It was well defined path that many of my peers would walk with me and it ends after college. I know I struggled (and still do to some extent) with how to define success for myself after completing the prescribed path set out by my family, community and peers.

Once I entered the "real" world I had to suddenly define success for myself. Did I want to really commit my time and energy to the corporate ladder? When there are no due dates, how do I justify ditching my friends so I can sit alone in a room and draw? Who should I surround myself with? How much time should I devote to those relationships? How important is exercise and fitness? How do I want to balance work and life?

These questions and answers are unique to everyone, and I know it's a privilege to have the definition of success as a problem in my life. But it's something that everyone should examine. I know I don't have it figured out entirely, but I'm ok with that. I'm aware of the question, and I have been implementing systems that work for me and help me define my own success and keep me on track. I encourage you to do the same.
