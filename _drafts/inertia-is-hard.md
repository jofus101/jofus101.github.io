title: Inertia is Hard

Inertia is a hard force to oppose.

I had dinner last night with an old friend who is grappling with the inertia of 4 years at a company that he no longer loves. In our discussion a couple things about inertia became apparent and mirrored my experience when overcoming inertia.

To be clear, I am talking about existential(? is that the word I'm looking for) inertia. A sense that you've been doing things for a couple years, and it's not great, but it's not bad.  And who the hell knows what waits for you on a different path; it could be better, but it could be worse.

His experience mirrored mine while working for Microsoft. I had a good gig there. They treat their employees really well on every metric, my managers were great, my coworkers were all good hella smart people, and I worked on Outlook, a product that ~10% of the world uses (kinda made that up, but I don't think I'm far off). But I was unhappy for reasons that don't really matter (in fact, like love, you don't really need reasons), and after a year or so, the only thing keeping me there was that I didn't know exactly what kind of life I wanted. I didn't take the time to really think about [what success looked like for me]() and as a result wasn't able to visualize what life would be. 

This desire for a clear visual of my exact future and how it would be better than my current situation was an impossible task. I used the lack of this clear vision as a crutch to hold my life in place; inertia bound

Looking back, I realize that the desire for a clear visual of exactly what my future would look like (an impossible task) and  was an excuse I made to remain where I was; inertia bound. 

I have learned more about my goals and desires in the past 2 years of [failing]() than I have at any other point in my life. 

So I encourage you to go out and fail. You get to decide what kind of life you live. In life as in love if it's not a resounding [fuck yes it's a no](http://markmanson.net/fuck-yes).

Take comfort in the fact that we're all gonna die and live a little :)
