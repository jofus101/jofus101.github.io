I studied Computer Science and Sculpture at Washington University in St.Louis while simultaneously learning how to climb, dance, and blow glass. I spent 3 years as a Developer for Microsoft Outlook before moving to Brooklyn in 2014 to start a company. I love learning new things and decided to help other people do the same. 

Some projects I have or am working on:

* [Shuhari](http://shuhari.io) - An open learning community
* [Shuhari: Poi](http://poi.shuhari.io)
* [Bandpass](http://bandpass.fm) - A better way to find local shows
